cope is a wrapper around programs that output to a terminal, to give
them colour for utility (and aesthetics).

For example, logfile output becomes much easier to read once errors
are highlighted in red, or searching through processes could be helped
if the running user is colour-coded.

You'll need Perl >= 5.10, and a working version of CPAN.

Installation is the standard procedure:

- perl Makefile.PL
- make
- make test
- sudo make install

Then, find out where perl put the scripts:

$ perl -MFile::ShareDir=dist_dir -e "print dist_dir('Cope').\$/"

And add that to your $PATH.
