=head1 NAME

App::Cope::Manual - User guide for cope

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<cope> is a wrapper around programs that output to a terminal, to
give them colour for utility (and aesthetics).

For example, logfile output becomes much easier to read once errors
are highlighted in red, or searching through processes could be helped
if the running user is colour-coded.

=head1 INSTALL

Standard 4-command Perl install procedure:

- perl Makefile.PL
- make
- make test
- make install

Once you've installed cope, just add the directory to your $PATH:

  export PATH="/path/to/scripts/:$PATH"

And the programs in the scripts directory will automatically colourise
their counterparts.

=head1 RUNNING

Instead of filtering input through a single executable, cope provides
a directory of scripts that examine the $PATH variable, run the
original script, and process its output through a filter defined in
that file.

This has many benefits: it requires no configuration other than
changing the $PATH, automatically highlights output from processes
spawned by processes, and most shells won't know the difference in
terms of tab-completion on arguments.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Although cope uses a pseudo-terminal to read its input, it doesn't
pretend to act like one. Applications that require a terminal to be
emulated - think editors, pagers, roguelikes - will fail miserably. If
you want to interact with one of them, write your own script using
C<Term::VT102> to parse the output.

=head1 TURNING FILTERING ON/OFF

To avoid clashes with other pipes, does not filter if its output isn't going
to a terminal.

The script F<nocope> runs a program without filtering it through cope.

Also, the environment variable NOCOPE is handled by all the scripts as
to run the program without the filter.

=head1 SUPPORT

There is no "stable" version; due to the number of programs that cope
has to support, any development version from the master branch is
bound to be working more or less correctly.

Please report anything wrong at all: either a bug within Cope, or if
something gets highlighted incorrectly or fails to be highlighted at
all.
